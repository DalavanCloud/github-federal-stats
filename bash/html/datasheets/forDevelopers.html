<h2>For Developers</h2>
<P>
<h3>Can I use GitHub?</h3>
Although there are federal ToS for GitHub usage, your federal agency needs to actually approve usage and accept the ToS.  If you are uncertain, you can check here for those which do approve usage.  If your agency is not listed, you can check <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/resources/agency-points-of-contact-for-federal-compatible-terms-of-service-agreements/">here</a> to find out who your agency POC is.
Organizational Administration
Since an administrator for an organization has the ability to view billing data for premium accounts (required if using private repositories), only federal employees should be included as organization administrators.
<br><br>
Organizations should include a bio, a website (under the &quot;blog entry&quot;), and an e-mail POC.
Repository Administration
Creation
In order to allow better usage of federal IT assets, care should be taken to provide descriptions for all repositories which will allow effective discovery.  A repository with a &quot;cool&quot; name and no description does not allow other federal developers to effectively reuse your code.
Scoping
If you are uncertain or whether or not your repository should be public or private, you should set it up to be private.  However, doing so will not allow others to be able to search the content for reuse, so setting it to private is most effective for the early stages (i.e. alpha) of a project until you are ready to have it available for more general usage.
<h3>Team Member Provisioning</h3>
<h4>Account Creation</h4>
If you have not created a GitHub account yet, do so with your government email (.gov or .mil), which will assist with records retention and will meet the federal ToS for GitHub.
If you already have a GitHub account, simply add your government email to your existing account. Do not create a new account. You can also set up custom email routing through the Notifications Center. Make sure your commits are signed with your government email address.
Note that signing commits with an email address is different from setting notifications to go to one or another email address. You also have to change the official commit email address attached to each repo.
If you are using your work computer for personal projects on GitHub and want your personal email tied to those commits, you can set your federal email as part of the global .gitconfig, then override on a repository level with your personal email. If you have both emails in your GitHub settings, though, they will both be tied to your GitHub account.
Make sure you have notifications turned on and make sure your notifications are set up they way you'd like them.
<h4>Security</h4>
Federal users should be required to use 2-factor authentication (2FA) for their GitHub access. GitHub access will not be provided to many federal repositories if 2FA is turned off. Also be sure to save your recovery codes in case you lose access to 2FA.
<br><br>
<h4>Personalization</h4>
Add your information to your account
Adding your information to your account makes it easier for your team to know who you are, but most of all, doing so helps a lot with autocomplete!
A complete public profile includes:
<ul>
<li>	Company: Your government agency.
<li>	Location: Your primary work location (City, State).
<li>	Email: A verified government email address.
</ul>
Add a profile avatar
Adding an avatar is a courtesy that makes it easier for your teammates to identify you.  The avatar does not have to be an actual headshot, but should be unique.  To add an avatar, you go to your settings page to upload a picture.
<h3>Team Creation</h3>
<ul>
<li>	Teams can give you administrative, write, or read permissions. Even if you have write access into a repository, we strongly encourage the submission of pull requests for improvements or fixes.
<li>	Contractors or external government collaborators should only be added to teams with scoped write permissions to the respositories they're working on. They should never have adminsitrative level rights. In order to separate out these permissions, create a team in the format of projectname-admins for government staff if necessary.
</ul>
<h3>Team Member Deprovisioning</h3>
When a team member leaves your organization, forks should be deleted.  See https://help.github.com/articles/removing-a-user-from-your-organization/ \
Collaborators
Federal partners, their current contractors, and staff of other government entities (state, county, city), should be welcomed to join as long as they comply with established standards. Anyone else should be evaluated on a case by case basis.

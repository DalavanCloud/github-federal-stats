    "body": "0.6.22\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nNote: (*) indicates an API change. \r\n\r\n- NEW: Pull out three.js render into an overridable function so application can replace with its own (to work with shaders, multiple viewports, etc)\r\n- NEW: Notify user if websocket connection is blocked\r\n- NEW: Add polyfill for performance.now. Refs #3046\r\n- NEW: `kernel.{prototype,behaviors,prototypes,prototypes(...,true)}` tests.\r\n- NEW: Add calledMethod handler to the view to prevent interpolation when animation functions are called with a duration of 0. Refs #3046\r\n- NEW: Add Pace.min.js loading bar to VWF startup window.\r\n- NEW: Interpolate between transforms on frames between ticks.\r\n- NEW: Move per-prototype `initialize` from `model/javascript` to the kernel.\r\n\r\n\tIn order for the javascript driver to create an async break between\r\n\tcalls to a node's prototype `initialize` functions, it needs to call\r\n\tback into `kernel.execute` and iterate using the `execute` callback. But\r\n\tkernel reentry is during replication. The driver can't make the extra\r\n\thop through the kernel to execute its script. It needs to execute it\r\n\tdirectly.\r\n\r\n\tThis commit makes the kernel responsible for applying the prototypes'\r\n\tinitializers to the node. Using the new `initializingNodeFromPrototype`\r\n\thandler, the kernel directs drivers to run the relevant prototype\r\n\tinitializers on the node. The kernel provides an async break between\r\n\tinitializations when needed.\r\n\r\n\tDrivers only need to apply one initializer at a time. They no longer\r\n\tneed to search through the prototype chain and don't need to be\r\n\tconcerned about waiting for async operations from a prototype's\r\n\tinitializer to complete before calling a derived node's initializer.\r\n\r\n\tAn added benefit is that multiple drivers can perform partial\r\n\tinitialization correctly (such as if two scripting systems are active).\r\n\tPreviously, one driver would execute initialization for the entire\r\n\tprototype chain without allowing the next driver to interleave its\r\n\tinitialization for the same nodes.\r\n\r\n\tReferences #2417.\r\n\r\n- NEW: Make jQuery and bootstrap load as RequireJS modules to remove them from the global namespace. Refs #3108, #3109\r\n- CHG: New loader screen!\r\n- CHG: Turn eval script into regular code so optimizer doesn't break it\r\n- CHG: Change humvee-lesson driving to use translateTo, so it's not interpolated. Refs #3046\r\n- CHG: Refactor `kernel.prototypes` slightly to remove duplicated code.\r\n- CHG: Rearrange order of prototype array so nodes come before their behaviors\r\n- CHG: Fix prototypes function so that it doesn't skip the behaviors of the first level prototype. Refs #2417\r\n- CHG: Adding compatibility checking back into index.html for older browsers.\r\n- CHG: Adjust EventLag minimum sampling to account for event lag of Three.JS\r\n- CHG: Clean up duplicate code in renderScene. Refs #3046\r\n- CHG: Fix mouse navigation. Refs #2417\r\n- CHG: Only save nodes that are 3D objects for interpolation\r\n- CHG: Fix example/transforms so that it doesn't throw errors before the app is fully loaded. Refs #3046\r\n- CHG: In the nodejs reflector, store the time a new client connects to use for the time in the setState message.\r\n- CHG: Change tick messages so they don't have an action. Refs #3046\r\n- CHG: Add /r flag to RMDir to fully remove node-modules folder\r\n- CHG: Only move queue forward on ticks\r\n- CHG: Moved some functions private, eliminate matCpy for goog.vev.mat4.clone, avoid kernel access.\r\n- CHG: Fix applications that depend on jQuery or bootstrap. Refs #3120\r\n- CHG: Remove old websocket check\r\n- CHG: Update build_windows_installer.nsi\r\n- CHG: Relative path changed to absolute for source control version of NSIS script.\r\n- CHG: Start a webpage with the local README loaded after install.\r\n- CHG: Create does not take vwfPath argument.\r\n- CHG: Update vwfCli.js to support multiple possible locations for VWF support files.\r\n- CHG: Update spacing in node_vwf.js\r\n- CHG: Combine nested-if into && conditional operator in node_vwf.js.\r\n- CHG: Add check for VWF_DIR truthy values.\r\n- CHG: Fix path checking order to fix Mac/Linux path lookup.\r\n- CHG: Wordsmith installation instructions\r\n- CHG: Removed the word folder in install documentation.\r\n- CHG: Update installation notes to tighten up wording.\r\n- CHG: Update installation page to match README.\r\n- CHG: Update readme.md to remove extra wording.\r\n- CHG: Add instructions on how to use vwf create / vwf to start node server.\r\n- CHG: Update Readme.md to fix wording.\r\n- CHG: Update to point to development as fork repo for VWF Core Developers.\r\n- CHG: Update readme.md to include new instructions for VWF 1.0 Windows install. Closes #3039\r\n- CHG: Added Core Developer instructions for Windows installation. Closes #3039\r\n- CHG: Update to installation procedures to break into user/app developer installation and core developer installation. Refs #3039\r\n- CHG: Remove VWF website from main VWF repository\r\n- CHG: No longer create default lights in every app - only if app doesn't create any itself (the create two directional lights and one ambient)\r\n- CHG: Remove/encapsulate external dependencies so they don't conflict with app dependencies\r\n"

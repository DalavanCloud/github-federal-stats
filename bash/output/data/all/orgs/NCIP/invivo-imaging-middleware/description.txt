The In Vivo Imaging Middleware (IVIM) (better known as IVI Middleware) is a set of open source tools and middleware that provide interoperability between DICOM and the caGrid. IVIM development is driven by common use cases from radiology and pathology for common activities, such as central review in image-based clinical trials and data and application sharing in secure high-performance environments.

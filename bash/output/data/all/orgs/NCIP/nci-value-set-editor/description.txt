The NCI EVS Value Set Editor is used to create and maintain CTS 2 value set and pick list definitions for loading into the LexEVS terminology server, which resolves the definitions against referenced terminologies. This initial prototype release is used internally to generate all value sets published by EVS, but will need further development to reach a broader user community.

REDHAWK Code Generators
Contains the source and build script for the REDHAWK SourceVITA49 component
Contains the source and build script for the REDHAWK SinkVITA49 component
This component performs a BPSK demodulation using a clock (reference) and a data input
This component filters and decimates data using the liquid-dsp library (http://liquidsdr.org). The only operational filter modes are lowpass and bandpass. The Output Rate property can only be set to a value that is a rational factor of the input rate.

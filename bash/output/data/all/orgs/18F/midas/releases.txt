We do releases every week or two and send out notes.  We're generally using [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/), but we're pre-1.0, so API can change at any time. We use the minor version for changes where there are significant installation process changes or API changes or a database migration is needed.\r\n  * If you want to keep up with the latest changes, we work in the \"devel\" branch.  If you are using devel, keep an eagle-eye on commits and/or join our daily standup.\r\n  * Currently stand-ups are at 11a PT / 2p ET, but since we might reschedule now and then so here is our calendar of public meetings:  https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=ultrasaurus.com_oja7dkbgf1cug9smkb8q8pn2b8%40group.calendar.google.com  Anyone interested in Midas is welcome to join standup, you can meet the team and we can figure out appropriate longer-format or offline follow-up if you have lots of questions.\r\n  * We also have a [wiki](https://github.com/18F/midas/wiki) where we keep various development notes. If anything is confusing or your questions are not answered there, please shout out on the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/midascrowd).\r\n\r\n# User Experience Improvements\r\n\r\n* Flat-comments w/ reply and markdown support\r\n  @brandtheisey (https://github.com/18F/midas/pull/693), inspired by @monkbroc (https://github.com/18F/midas/pull/687)\r\n* Working Group owners, Task requestor/participants panels moved to left column, which allows discussion to appear higher up on the page\r\n* Update new user welcome message, reported by @melodykramer, fixed by @polinadotio https://github.com/18F/midas/issues/661\r\n* As a task creator, I would like to see an introductory screen informing me of expectations\r\n  * https://github.com/18F/midas/issues/670\r\n\r\n# Admin Experience Improvements\r\n\r\n* Admin csv export for users and tasks @sefk\r\n * user.csv includes user_id,\tname,\tusername (email),\ttitle,\tbio,\tisAdmin,\tdisabled\r\n * task.csv includes project_id, name, description, created_date, published_date, assigned_date, creator_name\r\n* Admin can now delete events (from Projects/Working Groups)  https://github.com/18F/midas/pull/676\r\n\r\n# Developer notes\r\n\r\n* make sure to: npm update\r\n* Change migrate to safe in the development env file as default. Now that we have migration scripts, we don't need to use the Sails db creation features that don't play nice with safe-delete.\r\n* logging improvements! (note: config changes)\r\n  * We now use Winston for logging, which provides timestamps and other configurable features\r\n  * See config/log.js\r\n  * https://github.com/18F/midas/pull/669"

[\\#688](https://github.com/18F/midas/pull/688) ([phildini](https://github.com/phildini))\r\n\r\n- When editing an Opportunity state, clicking on the radio button label changes the state (not just the circle in front of the label) [\\#683](https://github.com/18F/midas/pull/683) ([monkbroc](https://github.com/monkbroc))\r\n\r\n- Add tag when clicking outside the input field [\\#682](https://github.com/18F/midas/pull/682) ([monkbroc](https://github.com/monkbroc))\r\n\r\n- Like button on Task detail page won't go negative anymore [\\#674](https://github.com/18F/midas/pull/674) ([monkbroc](https://github.com/monkbroc))\r\n\r\n- Linkedin authentication for midas-dev, including fix that removes locations since we geo-code them now [\\#666](https://github.com/18F/midas/pull/666) ([dhcole](https://github.com/dhcole))\r\n\r\n- Created a [github page](http://18f.github.io/midas/) -- promotional page for folk interesting in deploying Midas for their own orgs or contributing [\\#649](https://github.com/18F/midas/issues/649) \r\n\r\n- Fix menu active states [\\#658](https://github.com/18F/midas/pull/658) ([dhcole](https://github.com/dhcole))\r\n\r\n### Developer improvements\r\n\r\nNote:  lots of module changes, we recomend if you are upgrading an existing repo, run from project root:\r\n```\r\nrm -rf node_modules\r\nnpm install\r\nnpm run migrate\r\n``` \r\n\r\n- Client application refactor [\\#662](https://github.com/18F/midas/pull/662) ([dhcole](https://github.com/dhcole))\r\n\r\n  This release includes a refactoring of the client backbone application. We moved the client applciation architecture from Require.js to Browserify, which uses standard Node.js / Common.js `require('module')` statements. Also, several we removed several set-up steps. Now all commands that used to be run by `make` are handled directly by `npm run`, such as `npm run migrate` or `npm run build`.\r\n  \r\n  The [installation instructions](https://github.com/18F/midas/blob/devel/INSTALL.md) reflect these changes.\r\n  \r\n  After updating for the first time from the previous version, you may need to manually remove git submodules, which we no longer use. To do so, run `git status` and note any paths that are under `assets/js/vendor` or `public/` that are not checked in. Manually remove them with `rm [full path to unused submodule path]`. Or, you can simply move your midas repository directory to another path and clone the latest version of the reposity, then run `npm install && npm run migrate` to set up a new copy of the application.\r\n\r\n- Sometimes, file upload data is being stored as JSON [\\#589](https://github.com/18F/midas/issues/589)\r\n\r\n- Add /developer page  [\\#299](https://github.com/18F/midas/issues/299)\r\n\r\n- If git isn't installed, NODE\\_ENV=production fails on lift [\\#650](https://github.com/18F/midas/issues/650)\r\n\r\n- When I authenticate with MyUSA, it should show the correct page [\\#644](https://github.com/18F/midas/issues/644)\r\n\r\n- CrowdWork \\(windows\\) takes forever to start ORM on application start [\\#546](https://github.com/18F/midas/issues/546)\r\n\r\n- Browse tab highlight should be red, not gray [\\#648](https://github.com/18F/midas/issues/648)\r\n\r\n- Move client-side config to server [\\#646](https://github.com/18F/midas/issues/646)\r\n\r\n- configure dev server to support linkedIn [\\#626](https://github.com/18F/midas/issues/626)\r\n\r\n- Don't migrate the file table automatically [\\#684](https://github.com/18F/midas/pull/684) ([monkbroc](https://github.com/monkbroc))\r\n\r\n- Note on Windows install instructions [\\#675](https://github.com/18F/midas/pull/675) ([brandtheisey](https://github.com/brandtheisey))\r\n\r\n- Small setup improvements -- nvm to handle nodejs 0.10 dependency [\\#671](https://github.com/18F/midas/pull/671) ([sefk](https://github.com/sefk))\r\n\r\n- Fix the missing image problem [\\#665](https://github.com/18F/midas/pull/665) ([gboone](https://github.com/gboone))\r\n\r\n- Makes a header for How you can help section [\\#664](https://github.com/18F/midas/pull/664) ([gboone](https://github.com/gboone))\r\n\r\n- adds help us ribbon [\\#663](https://github.com/18F/midas/pull/663) ([gboone](https://github.com/gboone))\r\n\r\n- add link to Open Opps video  [\\#659](https://github.com/18F/midas/pull/659) ([ultrasaurus](https://github.com/ultrasaurus))\r\n\r\n- Update instructions in INSTALL.md.

An opportunity owner or admin can change the state. \r\n  * Open - open for volunteering and discussions, this is the default state \r\n  * Assigned - a volunteer has been assigned, discussion is still open \r\n  * Archived - closed in a incomplete or unstarted state, no volunteers or discussion        \r\n  * Completed - closed in a finished state.  Once an opportunity is closed no one can volunteer add to the  discussion  \r\nNote: Under the hood \"open\" opportunities used to be called \"public.\" \r\n* If you have a running instance with data, you will need to update the database. With this important imporvement, @brandtheisey included a handy tool ```./tools/postgres/rename-public-to-open-state.sh``` to easily update your data. See CONFIG.md for more details.  \r\n* Usability improvement: Allow adding multiple tags with comma separator for topics and skills -- thanks @monfresh! \r\n* In the last release, optional infinite scroll was added to browse projects & browse tasks, which is off by default (see CONFIG.md for details). @brandtheisey increased performance in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bugs fixed: \r\n* Sometimes when you created an opportunity with new tags, it would display \"We need 'no people yet assigned' to work on an opportunity\" in the description. @DavidEBest found and fixed a timing issue that we believe resolves this issue.\r\n"

(Further documented in CONFIG.md)\r\n* Chef scripts now support customized deploy\r\n* additional i18n configuration for signup and volunteer dialog text"

(When creating an opportunity, validation would be triggered on input fields losing focus even if their content hadn't changed or been update at all. Changed event listener to change instead of blur.)\r\n* Corrected problem with server hang when navigating directly to a task or a project (such as '/projects/1’)\r\n* Fix for too wide inputs on Opp Edit page\r\n\r\nthanks to @louh for isolating & reporting issues\r\ndesign contributions by @alwaysbrightblue\r\ncode contributions by @DavidEBest, @brandtheisey & @ultrasaurus\r\n"

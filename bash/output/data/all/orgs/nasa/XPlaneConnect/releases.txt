    "body": "## General Changes\r\n - All of the example scripts now check that they are connected before\r\n   sending commands.\r\n - The \"Docs\" folder has been removed from the repository. All information\r\n   previously documented there has been transfered to the wiki.\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n - A Python client has been added.\r\n - The sendCTRL command now supports setting speed-brakes.\r\n - The sendDREF command has been augmented with a sendDREFs variant that\r\n   supports setting multiple datarefs at once.\r\n - A sendVIEW command has been added that supports setting the camera view in\r\n   X-Plane.\r\n\r\n## Changes to the X-Plane Connect Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n - Greatly improved logging efficiency by keeping a single open file\r\n   descriptor for the entire program execution.\r\n - Improved consistency of includes. All C headers should now be included\r\n   using the <c*name*> style rather than \"*name*.h\" style.\r\n - Numerous methods and parameters that could be marked `const` have been.\r\n - Several value type string parameters have been replaced with const\r\n   references.\r\n - Logging has been refactored to take the logging level as a method parameter.\r\n - Trace logging has been made substantially more comprehensive.\r\n - Handling of default values (-998, -999) has been centralized in the `DataManager::IsDefault` and `DataManager::GetDefaultValue` methods.\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n - Fixed a bug where DataManager::SetGear would sometimes incorrectly log an\r\n   error when passed a default value.\r\n - The flight loop callback registration handling has been moved to the\r\n   enable/disable function pair instead of the start/stop pair. The plugin\r\n   manager seems to be smart enough to only call callbacks for enabled\r\n   plugins, but it still makes sense to unregister the callback completely\r\n   while disabled.\r\n\r\n## Changes to the C client\r\n - The unit test suite has been refactored. There is now one file per client\r\n   function. This should make it much easier to maintain and expand test\r\n   coverage in the future.\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nThe initial version of this release did not contain update Linux binaries. This issue has been corrected in the v1.1.1 download below."

    "body": "## General Changes\r\n - Most \"readme\" and \"user guide\" files have been removed. Instead, refer to the [XPC Client Reference](https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect/wiki/XPC-Client-Reference) and [XPC Developer Information](https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect/wiki/XPC-Developer-Information) sections of this wiki.\r\n - Todo items and other administrative notes have been removed from source files. Many of these items were out of date; those that were not have been moved to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect/issues).\r\n\r\n## Changes to the X-Plane Connect Plugin\r\n - Linux binaries are now included in the plugin folder.\r\n - The internal structure of the plugin as been substantially refactored. Functionality has been broken into discrete segments and moved into separate classes.\r\n - These changes are primarily for ease of maintainability, and should not have any impact on users except as noted below.\r\n - Fixed bug [#30](https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect/issues/30)\r\n - Fixed bug [#31](https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect/issues/31)\r\n - Fixed bug [#39](https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect/issues/39)\r\n - The plugin and client no longer share any code.\r\n - The plugin now automatically responds to clients on the port that they send from.\r\n\r\n## Changes to the C Client\r\n - **Only one socket is now needed by the client. As a result, several functions that previously took two `xpcSockets` now only need one.**\r\n - **The unused `open` field has been removed from `xpcSocket`.**\r\n - The `xpcSocket` structure has been typedefed to `XPCSocket` to remove the need to use the `struct` keyword everywhere. The `xpcSocket` name has been retained in the struct namespace, so the structure can be refered to by either `struct xpcSocket` or `XPCSocket`.\r\n - The `readUDP` and `sendUDP` function have been removed from the header since they are intended only to be used internally by the client.\r\n - The signature of several functions in the C client have been modified to better match their counterparts in MATLAB and Java.\r\n  - Added `aopenUDP` function that automatically opens the socket using an OS selected port.\r\n  - `readUDP` now takes a `len` argument that specifies the size of the read buffer. Previously it was assumed that the read buffer was 5000 bytes long. This change should not affect most users since `readUDP` is primarily used internally by other client functions.\r\n  - `readUDP` no longer takes a `recvaddr` argument since it was only used by the plugin.\r\n  - **`readDATA` now takes a `rows` argument indicating the maximum number of rows that will fit in the `dataRef` array.**\r\n  - The type of `rows` in the `sendDATA` function has been changed to `int` to improve consistency with other clients.\r\n  - **`requestDREF` has been renamed to `getDREFs`.**\r\n  - A convenience function called `getDREF` has been added that gets a single dataref.\r\n  - **`getDREFs` now takes a single socket and its other parameters have been reordered to match other clients.**\r\n  - **`sendDREF` has been renamed to `setDREF`.**\r\n  - **The `setDREF` function no longer takes a parameter for the length of the dataref. It now uses `strnlen` instead.**\r\n  - **The order of parameters in `sendPOSI` have been changed to be more consistent with other functions in the client.**\r\n  - The `psendPOSI` function has been added to send position for the player aircraft.\r\n  - **`sendpCTRL` renamed to `psendCTRL`.**\r\n  - **The order of parameters in `psendCTRL` and `sendCTRL` has been changed to match other clients.**\r\n  - **Values in the `WYPT_OP` enum have been capitalized.**\r\n\r\n## Changes to the MATLAB Client\r\n - The MATLAB client now uses the Java client internally. This change should be transparent to the end user.\r\n  - The `XPlaneConnect.jar` file has been added to the `+XPlaneConnect` folder in the MATLAB client. Since the MATLAB client is distributed as a folder already, hopefully this will not complicate deployment for end users.\r\n - Removed `readUDP` and `sendUDP` functions, which are now handled by the Java client internally.\r\n - **Removed unneeded `clearUDPBuffer` and `sendSTRU` functions.**\r\n - **Removed return values from several functions where they did not convey useful information.**\r\n - **Renamed `requestDREF` and `sendDREF` to `getDREFs` and `setDREF` respectively.**\r\n - **`IP` and `port` arguments have been replaced with a single `socket` argument that can be passed the resulting socket from a call to `openUDP`.**\r\n\r\n## Changes to the Java Client\r\n - **The order of arguments to the `XPlaneConnect` constructor have been changed to match the `openUDP` function in other clients.**\r\n - Added `selectDATA` and `readDATA` commands.\r\n "

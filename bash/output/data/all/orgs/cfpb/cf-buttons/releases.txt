What's also sweet is that cf-core has some handy utilities and mixins that can be leveraged.\r\n\r\n**Updated the naming conventions to use BEM.** You can [read more about how we use BEM in the contributing section of the CF docs](http://cfpb.github.io/capital-framework/contributing/#follow-our-css-naming-conventions)."

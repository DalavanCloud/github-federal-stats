    "body": "- Removes the blockquote styling with the green background and padded box. It's now just using the default text and default left/right margins with some custom top/bottom margins. This is more inline with the current quoting usage on cf.gov anyway and is good for quoting large blocks of text as it doesn't detract from the text around it in the way that the other style did.\r\n- Added a `.pull-quote` pattern. In the `cfgov-refresh` repo we're combining this with `.line-container` to get top and bottom borders. These misc. styles should be made available as a CF component in the future.\r\n- Adds faux italic and bold fixes anytime the `.webfont-regular()` mixin is used. Now you don't have to manually add it every time you use that mixin. For those who cry \"bloat!\" you should gzip your compiled CSS."

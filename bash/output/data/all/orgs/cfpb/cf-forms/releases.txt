This means that you no longer need to use cf-forms if all you need is base input styles, use cf-core for that. Read more about the [first release of cf-core](https://github.com/cfpb/cf-core/releases/tag/0.1.0).\r\n\r\nBecause of the move to cf-core, **cf-forms is now the home of form styling beyond base styles**, like validation styles, label headers, form groups, and form icon patterns. Also, as always, we should add to this when we see fit, there are more form patterns we'll be needing.\r\n\r\n**Formatting fixes**, like removing unnecessary prefixes and updating syntax.\r\n\r\n**Updates the docs template** which adds a nicer design and an \"edit on codepen\" button on HTML patterns."

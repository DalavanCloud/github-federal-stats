    "body": "* **Breaking API change:** encounter `finding` is now a list called `findings`\r\n* **Breaking API change:** pure dates are now output in the JSON as date strings (like \"04/27/2014\") instead of local-timezone midnight datetimes (like \"2014-04-27T08:00:00.000Z\"). Datetimes are still output the same way.\r\n* Major new feature: C-CDA generation from BB JSON\r\n* Lots of additions to the parser, including:\r\n    * smoking status\r\n    * cognitive/functional statuses\r\n    * medication schedule (the \"time\" component of a sig)\r\n    * document author metadata\r\n* Fixed a bug that resulted in valid C-CDAs built on one of the eight templates besides `ContinuityOfCareDocument` failing to parse\r\n* Lots of internal work to clean up code organization / improve the test suite\r\n"

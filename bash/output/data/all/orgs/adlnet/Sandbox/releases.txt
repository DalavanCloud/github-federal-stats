    "body": "# v0.9.0\r\n\r\nWell, it's been a very long time since we did a release, but I'm please to confirm that we are quickly approaching a stable 1.0 release. This update includes many many small fixes, a few big performance improvements, and one or two big new features.\r\n\r\n## Physics with Ammo.js\r\nFirst and foremost, I'm please to announce our integration with Ammo.js, a port of the Bullet physics engine. This brings to the Sandbox one of the most popular opensource physics engines on the market, and should make it possible to build much more interesting environments quickly. We've integrated many great features from the library including compound collision shapes, several types of constraints, and collision materials. You'll find on the sidebar a new tab with most of the physics options, as well as a new menu under \"Create\".\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1257870/5440588/e8e13f98-8457-11e4-9bd6-a602ba5b696d.png)\r\n\r\nHere you can set the basic physical object parameters like mass or friction. For primitive objects, the collision body will exactly match the settings for the primitive. You can even link together objects using the link tool. Objects which are children of other objects become part of a compound collision.\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1257870/5440691/b77d673c-8458-11e4-89c3-fc03546753de.png)\r\n\r\nThe Physics Editor will also show you a preview of the collision body - here you can see the compound collision body of several linked primitives.\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1257870/5440766/3b6ab432-8459-11e4-8ed3-7e6db9d0f651.png)\r\n\r\nYou'll also get a preview for constraints. This is a hinge joining two bodies\r\n\r\nFinally, we've added an entire API for manipulating the physics on an object. Type `this.physicsAPI` for hints in the ScriptEditor.\r\n\r\n## Object Libraries\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1257870/5440814/9f4fd8d8-8459-11e4-8e89-929ebb3ece18.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an ongoing effort to create sample content, we've added some objects to a special new sidebar on the left. These objects will always be available while in Edit mode. Click and drag them into the scene to create one. The objects can be 3D entities, materials, behaviors or environments. We'll be adding more demo content in the future, as well as a way for you to load up libraries via a URL.\r\n\r\n## GUI Refresh\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1257870/5440863/0125a4b6-845a-11e4-8cd3-12ee718ed8eb.png)\r\n\r\nThe old GUI was great, and we much prefer it to the original. Continuing with that trend, we've moved more of the theme to dark tones, and increased the number of highlight items. There are also more hover actions, more tooltips, and cleaner lines.\r\n\r\n## Lots more\r\n### Updated user data interfaces\r\nWe've moved much of the identity tracking into a property on the main scene. You can now access information about connected clients with `this.Scene.clientAPI` and `this.Scene.clients`\r\n### WebVR\r\nWe got our hands on an Oculus! If you have a WebVR compatible browser, try it out! This is a work in progress, expect more soon.\r\n### Performance improvements\r\nCheck out the commit logs from early October - we've been busting our butts to bring you that buttery smooth 60FPS you crave. We're now pooling and reusing many of the objects that are created at each frame. We've also made significant updates to the scene manager that tracks the locations of objects.\r\n### Bone Scaling\r\nBones can now scale independently of their parent scales - allowing for customization of character rigs. Check it out - open the \"Control Bone\" example, select a bone, and uncheck \"inherit parent scale\" at the Properties Window. \r\n### Updated Interpolation\r\nThe frame interpolation has been improved. You'll now see slower motion when the objects are near their proper locations, and faster when they are far. This seems to correct the small overshoot that caused some ugly single frame jitter in the past.\r\n### Active Synchronization\r\nIt's sometimes possible for the simulations to drift out of sync - especially when there are bugs! The server is not actively resetting objects over time, so even a large sync error should disappear over time.\r\n### Context Loss Restore\r\nIn some rare occasions, the browser can loose the WebGL context, and destroy all our graphics. When the context is restored, we can now rebuild our entire scene and continue on. There may be some graphics problems, but the simulation should continue on."

    "body": "This release brings some important under-the-hood updates, and a few major changes up front as well. \r\n\r\n### Updated User Interface\r\nThis should be obvious - we've updated the graphics of the main editor GUI to be more consistent and generally easier on the eyes. Though he's not mentioned in the commit logs, Jeff Mills from ADL did an enormous amount of work to align all the mismatched icons into a single unifying visual design, and updated the styles to be more legible and consistent. You'll also notice several little updates to the shape of the on screen tool gizmos.\r\n\r\n***Old***\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1257870/3557960/601a740a-0936-11e4-9f50-d0986d6a74d6.png)\r\n\r\n***New***\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1257870/3557970/820c6dc0-0936-11e4-93c4-922909bad35d.png)\r\n\r\n### Social Media Login\r\nWe've switched the under-the-hood login system to use the excellent [passport.js](http://passportjs.org/). This allows us leverage many different social media login systems. We're currently integrating with Facebook, Google and Twitter, but now that the infrastructure is in place, adding more systems like Yahoo or Microsoft should be simple. Special thanks to @rbjarnason for much of the work in updating the under-the-hood session management. We've also hooked up [cookie-session](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/cookieSession.html) for more scalable session management.\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1257870/3558049/7ba3c3f6-0937-11e4-8fda-bc69d391bf9d.png)\r\n\r\n### Bone Handles\r\nSince we build an octree to organize the scenegraph for picking, we must sort the geometry of a rigged mesh based on the values known CPU side. This can create issues where, when GPU skinning is used, the mesh appears at a location significantly differently than the location where the CPU thinks it is. So, you will sometimes select the mesh when you click on what looks like empty space, or you will not be able to select the mesh though you are clearly clicking on it.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this, we've started creating proxy bounds for the rigs bones. These bounding objects are sorted into the octree just like normal geometry, allowing you to click on the visual representation of the mesh, even if it is offset by the skinning shader. This is not pixel accurate, but should provide a much better bound for rigged meshes. This also makes it possible to select bones. In the image below, you can see some bone handles are grey, and others red. Red bone handles are associated with a VWF node, and can be selected and manipulated, or even scripted, just like any primitive. Grey bones are internal to the mesh and not editable. When you associate a VWF node with a bone using the Hierarchy panel, you'll see the color update accordingly. To show or hide the bones, use *Rendering->Show Bones* from the main menu.\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1257870/3558224/89cd31b8-0939-11e4-915f-e6aa2a560a90.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other updates\r\n1. Make the 'Create' button on the homepage prompt to launch the blank example world if no user is logged in.\r\n1. Preliminary support for [glTF](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF). Thanks @digitaledge !\r\n1. Update to Three.js r67\r\n1. Fixes to admin pages. @NikolaySuslov\r\n1. Use [spdy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPDY) over SSL\r\n1. DDS Texture support @digitaledge \r\n1. Make scale tool less useless\r\n1. Fix the character controller's annoying orientation problem"

    "body": "Apologies for taking so long getting the documentation out. \r\n\r\n### Play/Pause\r\nThis release includes major changes to the expected workflow for users - instead of the world being \"always on\", we are introducing the idea of the 'PlayMode'. This is a property on the scene that controls whether or not the simulation is currently active. Check out the GUI below:\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1257870/3558285/38bbdee0-093a-11e4-8a2c-bb248a03cc2d.png)\r\nThe bright red GUI indicates that the world is currently playing, and the editor tools are not active. The buttons in the bottom left can be used to stop the world, at which point it will revert to whatever state it was in when it began playing. I expect that this will make it significantly easier to author applications that have a well defined beginning and end, rather than a persistent world which can be hard to reset. You can also test what your published world will look like by choosing *World Settings* from the *File* menu.\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1257870/3558331/a6763868-093a-11e4-89dd-b1f1965a6c79.png)\r\n\r\nThese settings allow you to enter temporary settings for the world. You can then test them by choosing *File->Play World*. This will create a temporary duplicate of your application on the server with the specified publish settings, and launch it in a child window. Be sure to allow popups!. When you close the popup, the world will re-activate and the temporary one will be deleted. You must be the world owner to use this feature. \r\n\r\n### Ready\r\nSometimes you might want to have a scripted entity that does something when it is created. We used to use `initialize` for this, but the `intitialze` function fires before the object is hooked up to its parent. Try using `ready` for all startup activities - this function will be called on your object whenever the path from it to the scene root becomes available, and the scene root itself is ready and not waiting on any additional nodes to load.\r\n\r\n### Client-side User Management\r\nWe also have a new way of tracking what users are in the scene. The root node (scene) object contains a property - `clients` that contains information about the users connected to the world. There are also events you can bind to in order to have your application receive notifications about new users. \r\n\r\n```\r\n  function ready()\r\n  {\r\n     this.Scene.bind('clientConnected , function(socketID,username,userID)\r\n     {\r\n           alert('hello ' + username);\r\n     });\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nWe also are exposing a nicer API for getting information about logged in users - type `this.Scene.clientAPI.` in the script window to get the popup documentation.\r\n### Event Propagation\r\nIn order to more closely align with the VWF base library, I've fixed the way we propagate events to match theirs. We used to pass events to child nodes if the target node does not handle them - this allows the keypress events to fire handlers on any node in the simulation - it's why `this.keydown(...)` worked. This however causes all sorts of other weirdness. Now, the keypress events are only triggered on the Scene. If you need to catch them in a child node, do so like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  function ready()\r\n  {\r\n     var self = this;\r\n     this.Scene.bind('keypress, function(e,evt)\r\n     {\r\n           if(e.key.char == 'W') self.move();\r\n     });\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBe sure to unbind this function when a node is deinitialized:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  function ready()\r\n  {\r\n     var self = this;\r\n     this.keypressHandle = function(e,evt)\r\n     {\r\n           if(e.key.char == 'W') self.move();\r\n     }\r\n     this.Scene.bind('keypress, this.keypressHandle);\r\n  }\r\n  function deinitialize()\r\n  {\r\n     this.Scene.unbind('keypress, this.keypressHandle);\r\n  }\r\n```"

    "body": "Huge update that actually looks like just a few commits. We're finally ready to show a couple of tools that have been in the works for a while. \r\n\r\n## Mesh Upload!\r\nYou can finally upload models directly through the Sandbox interface. As usual, the actual mesh storage and conversion is handled in our related project, the 3DR. However, in the past, you would have to go create a separate account on the 3DR, upload a model, and then find it with the 3DR search tool back in the Sandbox. This was far too much overhead, and I don't think users we're even aware this path exists. I've added a dialog within the Sandbox that will proxy data up to the 3DR, and append account credentials on the users behalf. If conversion works properly, the new mesh will appear right in the world, and will also be entered in the users inventory.\r\n\r\n## SSL Support\r\nThis has been almost ready to go for a while, but not quite there. We've added the config options to the config file and config example, and made the server redirect from the non-SSL port to the SSL port. The test page now works properly as well. I do think there might be a necessary update to the loadbalancer.js script. We're not using that in production yet, so it might be able to wait.\r\n\r\n## IE Support\r\nWe actually did very little to make this happen. The most recent version of IE seems to support the missing WebGL features, and every thing seems to work! We did need to make a small update to the terrain engine. Since we pipe huge bits of data between threads, we we're using transferable objects to keep the overhead of passing the data down. Unfortunately, this is not supported in IE. We now fallback on normal thread data passing in IE. I also expect that the RTC will fail under IE, but that might be a moot point. (See below)\r\n\r\n## GUI Entities\r\nOne of the issues that frequently comes up is the difficulty in creating a GUI. Our previous examples all appended objects directly to the DOM. This really breaks the VWF model, because the `click` handlers by necessity contain what we could consider \"view\" side code, yet are loaded from within the model code. It was very tempting to use a closure or `.bind(this)` to access internals of the model. This breaks the VWF synchronization model in all sorts of ways. Now, we have a toolset to create jQueryUI elements within the model itself. \r\n\r\n## Issues\r\n### WebRTC \r\nThe WebRTC video conference feature seems completely broken. This is very unfortunate, and it's at the top of the list on things to fix. \r\n### 3DR Object Metadata\r\nThe objects that are uploaded to the 3DR don't currently contain any metadata - it's hard to find them in the 3DR if you don't have the PID saved into your inventory. Next steps on this topic will be to add metadata and a screenshot for each model.\r\n### Terrain in IE\r\nIt's so slow, we might need a different approach. I think this might be due to the huge amount of data being passed from the thread pool. Some of this might be better when and if we switch out the terrain tiles from THREE.Geometry to THREE.BufferGeometry\r\n\r\n### Log\r\n1. Finish work on SSL support.\r\n1. Finally deploy the GUI Node toolset\r\n1. Integrated 3DR upload\r\n1. Fixes to make grass system more stable and usable\r\n1. Proper error handling of malformed UTF8JSON format models\r\n1. Disable use of transerable objects in terrain thread pool. Now works in IE.\r\n1. Minor error fix when starting up and creating default directories."

    "body": "## Update 1/9/14 (v0.4.11.1)\r\nWe've deployed our new server infrastructure! We're now hosting a developer blog and documentation site on the main server. Just click the Blog or the Documentation link from header at http://vwf.adlnet.gov to see the new setup. This will become or main location for documentation, updates, FAQ and Q&A. Since this is not really a new software release, we won't make a new tag, but it deserves a mention.\r\n\r\n### v0.4.11\r\nThis release is largely about usability and bugfixes. There are few new features, but a lot of work on some little GUI annoyances and some asset loading bugs. Notably, we're now dealing better with UV coordinates of imported models that lack them, and we're proxying 3DR traffic through the VWS server. This allows us to use the server configuration file to specify exactly what 3DR server to use. \r\n\r\n### GUI fixes:\r\n* Updates to the styles in the chat window.\r\n* Fix for the sidebar, which sometimes would scroll content horizontally\r\n* Fix for the materials editor, which would sometimes show an error message on 'sub assets'\r\n* Slight style and functionality updates to autocomplete in the script editor\r\n* Missing textures now show a broken image link, instead of a thin line in the texture tab\r\n* Slight adjustment to the `bumpscale` of a bump map\r\n* Change in the way the Euler angles are displayed in the Transform tab\r\n* First pass on the Spanish language translation\r\n* Copy and paste materials\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n* Proxy traffic to and from the 3DR\r\n* Allow the 3DR endpoint to be configured\r\n* Moved audio functions to `this.audioAPI... `\r\n* Shorter timeout for unresponsive clients\r\n* Better mapping in sphere projection UV map\r\n* Offset U and V parameters in UV map modifier\r\n* Slight caching issue with `materialDef` properties sometime caused material to fail to update\r\n* Some infrastructure work to support a blogging platform. We'll eventually reverse proxy via Nginx  to hit the VWS server or a Wordpress server\r\n* Save whenever someone logs out - it was possible before that an anonymous lurker would prevent a registered user from saving state when they leave, then the anonymous user would not save on logout. This could cause data loss up to 1 min per anonymous client.\r\n\r\n### New feature:\r\nTriggers! These are behaviors that do something when something happens in the scene. You can find them on the main menu under *create->behaviors->triggers*. Most useful is probably the 'Proximity Trigger\" which will call a function when an object get within a certain distance. Much better than polling at every tick and computing distance.\r\n\r\n### Changelog:\r\nhttps://github.com/adlnet/Sandbox/compare/master...v0.4.11_candidate\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"

This is a sample project using the API SDK for iOS that demonstrates how it can be used for non-DOL APIs. This universal (iPhone & iPad) app displays a list of agencies provided by a GSA-owned web service that the user can then select to view that agency's progress with the digital strategy. Currently, the only agency list available is a list of all agencies, regardless of whether they're reporting progress on the federal digital strategy (some are agencies within a cabinet department).

The solution begins with the question “Was this page helpful,” which captures the feedback from the user about the page that is displayed on the browser. This can be easily integrated in all or desired pages as per the need. Once the data is gathered and stored in database, the data can be viewed in different views by supervisor(s) or administrator(s). This solution can be applied to as many websites as you desire and connect to one or many database(s).

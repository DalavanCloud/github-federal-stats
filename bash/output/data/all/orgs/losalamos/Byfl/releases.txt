    "body": "Most of the [changes made since the last Byfl release](https://github.com/losalamos/Byfl/compare/v1.1-llvm-3.5.1...v1.2-llvm-3.5.1) focused on greatly improving the way Byfl tracks memory accesses by data structure (`-bf-data-structs`).  Byfl is now substantially better at identifying data structures and associating accesses with the correct data structure.  In addition, Byfl now provides `bf-clang` and `bf-clang++` compiler wrappers and, for people who prefer [`pkg-config`](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/), a configuration file for that tool.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, [DragonEgg](http://dragonegg.llvm.org/) is a dead project.  Development seems to have halted circa November 2014.  DragonEgg fails to build against either GCC 4.9+ or LLVM 3.6+ (despite there being a DragonEgg 3.6 release).  The last working combination appears to be revision 223694 of LLVM, Clang, and DragonEgg and version 4.8 of GCC, and that's what this revision of Byfl was tested against (as well as LLVM/Clang/DragonEgg 3.5.1 and LLVM/Clang 3.6).  With its new support for the Clang compilers, Byfl no longer requires DragonEgg to be useful and will soon return to building against LLVM trunk.  Furthermore, because LLVM 3.6 is out, Byfl's [`llvm-3.5`](https://github.com/losalamos/Byfl/tree/llvm-3.5) branch will be largely frozen.\r\n\r\nThe important implication is that **this is likely to be the last Byfl release that supports Fortran and Go** until either DragonEgg development resumes or LLVM-based compilers for Fortran and Go appear on the scene."

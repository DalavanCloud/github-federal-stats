    "body": "This release represents [a few improvements to the build process](https://github.com/losalamos/MPI-Bash/compare/v1.1...v1.2).  First, a `--with-plugindir` option lets a user easily override the directory in which `mpibash.so` and `circlebash.so` get installed.  Second, the `mpibash` wrapper script is cleaner and more robust.  Third, scripts that rely on Circle-Bash are not installed if Circle-Bash is not installed (typically because [Libcircle](http://hpc.github.io/libcircle/) was not available at configuration time).\r\n\r\nThere are no changes to the implementation of any of the MPI-Bash (or Circle-Bash) loadable builtin functions.  However, the `mpibash` wrapper script no longer defines the `MPIBASH_PLUGIN` and `CIRCLEBASH_PLUGIN` environment variables.  Instead, it puts the plugins in the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` so a simple `enable -f mpibash.so mpi_init` will work."

    "body": "This release represents a significant improvement to the way that MPI-Bash is built and deployed.  Previously, in [version 1.0](https://github.com/losalamos/MPI-Bash/releases/tag/v1.0), MPI-Bash was distributed as a set of patches to the Bash source code and was therefore tied to a specific version of Bash (Bash v4.3, to be exact).  In version 1.1, MPI-Bash is built as a Bash plugin (\"loadable builtin\" in Bash terminology) and therefore enjoys some degree of forward and backward compatibility with Bash versions.  It still requires the Bash source code to build, but only because few if any Linux distributions provide the Bash development header files.  Finally. the MPI-Bash build process now uses the [GNU Autotools](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system) for their features and robustness."

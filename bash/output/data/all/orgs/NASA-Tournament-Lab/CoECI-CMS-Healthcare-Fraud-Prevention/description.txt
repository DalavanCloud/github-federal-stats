The Healthcare Fraud Prevention Partnership (HFPP) through United States Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in collaboration with NASAâ€™s Center of Excellence for Collaboration (CoECI), Harvard, and TopCoder developed software that supports a data exchange network that enables healthcare insurance-paying entities in both the public and private sector to safely and securely share information for purposes of prevention and detection of fraud, waste and abuse across partners.
